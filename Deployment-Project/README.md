## Project #2: Spoonful

- The users of this application would be anyone who loves food! Thiis application allows foodies to view food recipes on a blog, and also create their own posts.
- What inspired our team to make this application was that we all love food, and learning new recipes. The most important feature is that users are allowed to create their own posts

## Situation

- The application is a blog where users can access and share food recipes. Our team was inspired to create this application because we are all passionate about food and enjoy discovering new recipes
- We wanted to provide a platform for food lovers to not only explore various dishes but also contribute their own culinary creations

## Task

This project consists of two main parts the `server` and `public` folders

- The server folder contains the backend code and handles the logic and database management of the application. The public folder contains the frontend code and assets of the application. It is responsible for displaying the user interface and interacting with the server through API calls. The design process involved brainstorming ideas, creating wireframes and mockups.

### Action

- We used the useEffect function from the React library to fetch data from the backend API and update the state of the application. This allowed us to dynamically display recipe information.
- We implemented routing using React Router to navigate between different pages of the application without refreshing the entire page

### Result

- The final application is a interface where users can browse create posts for recipes. Upon selecting a recipe, detailed information including ingredients and instructions are displayed. Users can also edit and create their own posts.

## Competencies

### JF 1.5

Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software

- In this project, my role was to work on the routes and design the front end for the posts. I made each post include the card component, which included an edit button and a description.
- My role of working on the front end was just a small portion of building the entire application. Seeing every part come together helped me understand the importance of working in teams and how effective it can be in producing software.

### JF 4.3

Is able to build, manage and deploy code into the relevant environment

- In this project we used github actions to automate the process of building and testing the application whenever changes were pushed to the repository.
- This allowed me to learn how to use CI/CD in a real world example. This ultimately helped me work better on my team and have a better understanding of my teams pipeline.
