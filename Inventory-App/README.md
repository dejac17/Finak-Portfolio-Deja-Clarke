# Project #4: Inventory App

## High-level Project Overview

Give a high-level overview of the project purpose

- This fullstack project was created to allow users to manage the inventory of a website. Users can add, edit, and delete products from the inventory, as well as track their availability and prices.

- We were given this project as a task for our boot camp. Throughout the development process, we utilized various technologies to create a user interface. Additionally, we implemented backend functionalities using frameworks to handle data storage and retrieval.

### Situation

- The application is designed to provide a user friendly interface for managing the inventory of a website. We created this program to simplify the process of adding, editing, and deleting products. By utilizing various technologies and frameworks, we aimed to develop an efficient and effective solution for inventory management.

### Task

This project consists of two main parts, the `public`, and `server` folders. We used this design process to simplify the division between the backend and front end work.

- The `public` folder contains the front end code for the application. The front end code in the public folder includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
- The `server` folder contains the application's backend functionalities, implemented using frameworks such as Node.js and Express.js, enable data storage and retrieval from a database. This ensures that product information is accurately stored and easily accessible for efficient inventory management.

### Action

- To achieve the desired result, I wrote code using React.js to create the user interface components. The HTML and CSS files were used to structure and style the components, while JavaScript was used to handle user interactions and implement functionality.
- I also utilized Bootstrap for responsive design and styling. To enable data storage and retrieval from a database, I used frameworks such as Node.js and Express.js in the backend folder. These frameworks allowed me to implement server side functionalities.

### Result

- The final application showcases is a interface with responsive design, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the various components. Users can view products containing the products photo, description, and price.

## Competencies

### JF 5.5

Understands and can apply structured techniques to problem solving, can debug code and can understand the structure of programmes to identify and resolve issues

- Me and my team encountered multiple bugs and issues throughout the development of this application. We learned how to debug by thoroughly examining our issues and attempting to make changes.
- This resulted in me having a better approach when it comes to debugging, allowing me to resolve bugs easier in the future.

### JF 3.6

Can implement a RESTful API

- I helped create a Items.js file that contained the routes for get, post, delete and put for the different items on our website. This created a RESTful API because after a client makes a request, we were able to send back a response with json data on the item back.
- Emphasize the results of this action for your team or your learning.
  The results of this action helped by team create a fully functional full stack website, and also helped me gain a better understanding of backend work.
