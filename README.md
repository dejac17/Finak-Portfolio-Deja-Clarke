## Portfolio Introduction

üëãüèæ Hi, My name is Deja Clarke, I am a Backend Software Engineer Apprentice at Cisco. I am passionate about solving complex problems and I enjoy giving back to my community! I enjoy being a software engineer because it allows me to continuously learn and push myself beyond what I think is possible, while also being able to positively impact user experiences. I have worked on various teams focusing on frontend, backend, deployment, and fullstack development. I have found that I thrive when doing backend development, and working with cloud technologies. Currently, I am focused on building my skills using Terraform, Python, and cloud services, with a strong emphasis on optimizing infrastructure and enhancing application performance.

I Hope You Enjoy My Portfolio
